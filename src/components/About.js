			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p className='about__p'>
				Certified Fullstack Software Engineer with a robust background in
				strategy development. <br />
				<br />
				Through my 10+ years of corporate retail experience, I possess a unique
				viewpoint and approach to programming within the total business structure. <br />
				My thought process is strategic and robust, while keeping efficiency top
				of mind. <br />
				Programming allows me to leverage this high-level, unique skill set to
				delve into coding opportunities and toggle between big picture and small
				details to deliver thoughtful results. <br />
				<br />
				Outside of coding, you can usually find me underwater leading a group of
				divers across a reef or at a wreck. <br />
				As a certified Divemaster, I've been able to take my diving skills to
				the next level through 200+ dives all over the world.
